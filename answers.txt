1. The core features of Node.js and Express and why they are useful.
// Node.js is cool cause I can code with JS in the front and backend which makes my stack less complicated.
and making the backend much easier for frontend only engineers to understand.
// express takes out a bunch of boiler plate making my job easier. 

2. Understand and explain the use of Middleware?
//middleware are (sometimes) custom functions that I can spread across my endpoints to make my job easier and cleaner.
//middlware is basically a form of actions that happen to data bewteen the request and response.


3. The basic principles of the REST architectural style.
// making enpoints simple, understandable and easy to use. ( straight to the point )

4. Understand and explain the use of Express Routers.
// express routers keep my code clean and my run file/index.js clean and easy to read.

5. Describe tooling used to manually test the correctness of an API.
//Tools used for api testing are super helpful for checking endpoints ect.
//Like using Insomnia! allows you to make "fake"(not really fake but you get it) requests to specific endpoints (w/ or without data) and see the response!
